# TPBAPMeshViewer
Mesh opener for Treasure Planet: Battle at Procyon 

This program can open and convert .mdb mesh files.

It has to be run via CMD or PowerShell.
At the current state it only supports the -all command, which converts all of the meshes in the folder.
It creates two sub-folders: one with the mesh data and one with the texture name data.

The program can export to .OBJ, .MTL file generation is still pending because some reverse-engineering still has to be done.

More commands and documentation coming.
